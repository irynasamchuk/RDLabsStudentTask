# What next?
In this project you will have several tasks:

:one: You need to fix all failured test cases.

:two: You need to implement new test scenarious (you will get file with manual test cases).

:three: You need to add serenity reporting to project.

:four: And finally you need to run test in Jenkins.

# How to run tests?

__In IDEA:__ add meta filter __@debug__ to test which you want to run, and then run file __DebugRunner.java__

__From command line:__ add meta filter @debug to test which you want to run and use command: __mvn clean verify -DSUITE=DebugRunner__

To run all test cases which already implemented use __RegressionRunner.java__

:point_up: __For new tests__, please create __new runner__ with name __StudentsRunner__ with meta filter __@newTask__. Add this meta filter to all new test cases which you implements.
